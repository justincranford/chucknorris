Conduct a comprehensive analysis and remediation of the Chuck Norris quotes project, addressing critical issues identified in the current implementation.

## Critical Source Issues
**Data Source Validation:**
- Sources 2-4 in the scraper configuration are invalid:
  - Source 2 is an exact duplicate of source 1
  - Sources 3 and 4 are dead/broken links that return errors or no content
- Perform deep research on available Chuck Norris quote sources across the internet
- Identify and validate 3-5 reliable, active sources including:
  - Primary API endpoints (chucknorris.io, icndb.com)
  - Reputable websites with quote collections
  - Alternative APIs or databases
- Ensure all sources are functional and provide unique content

## CI/CD Workflow Optimization
**Streamline Testing Strategy:**
- Restrict CI testing to Ubuntu latest only - remove Windows, macOS, and older Ubuntu versions
- Use Python 3.14 exclusively (latest version) - eliminate testing matrix for older Python versions
- Remove unnecessary matrix strategy to simplify workflow

**Workflow Structure Issues:**
- Remove pre-commit hook execution from CI workflow - pre-commit should run locally, not in CI
- Add dedicated code coverage job with comprehensive reporting:
  - Generate coverage in all formats (HTML, XML, JSON, LCOV)
  - Upload coverage reports as workflow artifacts
  - Configure proper codecov integration with artifact storage

## Additional Tasks from Previous Optimizations
**From Prompt 1 Analysis:**
- Ensure all CLI interfaces include comprehensive help with usage examples
- Verify parameterized testing covers all edge cases
- Confirm 95%+ coverage with detailed reporting
- Validate cross-platform compatibility despite simplified CI

**From Prompt 2 Analysis:**
- Audit all version references for absolute latest (November 2025)
- Verify branch naming (main vs master) is correctly implemented
- Confirm multiple source implementation with proper error handling
- Ensure all changes maintain backward compatibility

## Implementation Requirements
- Update scraper.py with validated, functional sources
- Refactor .github/workflows/ci.yml according to specifications
- Test all changes locally before committing
- Maintain existing test coverage and functionality
- Document all source changes and CI modifications

## Validation Steps
- Verify all new sources return valid Chuck Norris quotes
- Confirm CI workflow runs successfully on Ubuntu with Python 3.14
- Ensure coverage artifacts are properly generated and uploaded
- Test scraper with various source combinations
- Validate no regressions in existing functionality
