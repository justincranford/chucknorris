# Copilot Instructions

## General Principles

- Keep instructions short and self-contained
- Each instruction should be a single, simple statement
- Each instruction should not be verbose
- Do NOT duplicate information across instructions
- Do include external links to documentation when relevant
- Store instructions in properly structured files for version control and team sharing
- Keep reference links up to date between instruction files and project files (e.g., README.md)
