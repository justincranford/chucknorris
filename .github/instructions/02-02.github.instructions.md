# GitHub Workflow and Best Practices

## Documentation
- Maintain a descriptive README file
- Maintain an AGPL license file

## GitHub Workflows and Actions
- Maintain reusable and modular [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for use in [GitHub Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/workflows-and-actions/workflows)
- Always use the latest stable versions of all GitHub Actions
- Cache dependencies to speed up builds
- Structure GitHub Workflows to run different concerns concurrently (e.g., linting, testing)
- Test workflows locally when possible using tools like act
- Secure secrets and tokens properly

## Security
- Use [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) for security scanning
- Enable [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) for dependency updates
- Keep dependencies updated and audit for vulnerabilities
