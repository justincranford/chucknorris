# GitHub Workflow and Best Practices

## Documentation
- Maintain a descriptive README file
- Maintain an AGPL license file

## GitHub Workflows and Actions
- Maintain reusable and modular GitHub Actions for use in GitHub Workflows
- Always use the latest stable versions of all GitHub Actions
- Cache dependencies to speed up builds
- Structure GitHub Workflows to run different concerns concurrently (e.g., linting, testing)
- Test workflows locally when possible using tools like act
- Secure secrets and tokens properly

## Security
- Use CodeQL for security scanning
- Enable Dependabot for dependency updates
- Keep dependencies updated and audit for vulnerabilities
