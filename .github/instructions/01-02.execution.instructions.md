# Script Permissions
- Scripts must have 700 permissions (rwx------) on Unix-like systems

# Script Execution
- Scripts must be executed directly, without prefixing with the interpreter; e.g., `python`, `python3`, `bash`, `sh`, etc.
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT prefix Terminal commands with `cd` as it is unnecessary

# Python Scripts Execution
- On Windows: Use `py script.py` (Python launcher) or ensure .py files are associated with Python
- On Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS): Use `./script.py` after setting execute permissions
