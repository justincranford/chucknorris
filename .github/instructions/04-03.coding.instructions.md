# Coding Standards

## Python Style
- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) guidelines
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting (line length: 200)
- Sort imports with [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) (black profile)
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Write comprehensive docstrings ([Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html))
- Always use strong typing over `Any` where possible
 - ALWAYS fix all Pylance (Pyright) linting errors before committing; Pylance errors often indicate real issues and must be addressed promptly

## Code Organization
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Declare all magic values as named constants
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Validate all user inputs

## Editor & Tooling
- Use the `ms-python.vscode-pylance` extension in VS Code for fast, editor-based static analysis (Pylance uses the Pyright type checker under the hood)
- Note: The repo's pre-commit configuration currently runs `mypy` and other linters, but does NOT run Pylance/pyright by default; to block commits for type issues, enable a Pyright hook in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` or a local pre-commit hook that runs the `pyright` CLI

	If you want to add Pyright to pre-commit, you can either:
	- Add a node-based hook that runs the `pyright` CLI (installable via npm/yarn/pnpm) or
	- Add a local `pre-commit` hook that runs `npx pyright`/`pnpm dlx pyright`/`npm exec pyright` (depending on your tooling) to ensure type errors block commit

	Maintainers: When adding a Pyright hook to pre-commit, ensure CI runs the same check (either `pyright` or Pylance/Editor settings) so that PRs are validated and the commit hook behavior is consistent across developers and CI
