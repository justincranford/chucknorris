## Mandatory Python Version
- **MUST use Python 3.14** in ALL configurations
- Reference: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
- Do NOT downgrade to Python 3.12, 3.13, or any other version
- This requirement applies to:
  - pyproject.toml `requires-python` field
  - pyproject.toml classifiers
  - GitHub Actions workflows
  - All documentation
  - Pre-commit configurations

## Enforcement
- If Python 3.14 is not available in the current environment, acknowledge this but keep configuration set to 3.14
- Never change Python version without explicit user approval
- Always reference https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ when discussing Python versions
