# Testing Requirements
- ALWAYS use parameterized tests for happy and sad paths; they are more compact and clearer
- Ensure all tests pass and coverage >95%
- Use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) fixtures for reusable components
- Mock external dependencies (network, file I/O)
- Test edge cases, exceptions, boundary conditions, CLI args, and concurrency
- Identify missing branches via coverage analysis

# Validation After Changes
- Run full test suite and check coverage
- Validate functionality, error handling, and CLI interfaces
