Deep analysis of the entire project.

Identify things you missed.

Look at prompt1-optimized-claude.txt, there were things you missed there too.

Other issues I noticed:
- The GitHub CI workflow didn't run, because you initialized my git repo branch as master, but the ci.yml references main. You need to use main branch.
- You were supposed to use ALL LATEST VERSIONS of workflow actions and pre-commit plugins and python and all python tools. You used old versions. Find all of the versions referenced in my project and fix them.
- You were supposed to scrape multiple Chuck Norris online databases, I only see one mentioned.

Optimize and enhance this prompt for input into Claude 4.5; output it to prompt2-optimized-claude.txt.
