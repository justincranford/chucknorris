"""
Single executable hook script (`.githooks/pre-commit`) that runs the
repository's githook logic.

This script imports and executes `githooks.hooks.main` so the CLI logic is
implemented in the `githooks` package (for console scripts) while keeping a
single entry point file in the hooks directory that Git will execute.
